# Code Couplet VS Code Extension

TODO: blurb about why to use it (linked from main page)

### Usage

1. Select a block of comments + code, then press CMD+SHIFT+A (or the command: "Pinned Comments: link selection"). This will store the reference for the comment to the code. **Note**: right now it only supports comments that are not on the same line as the code.
2. When you save a file with a comment validation error, a diagnostic error will appear.

- If a linked comment was moved somewhere else in the file, a quick fix will let you update the mapping to the new location easily.
